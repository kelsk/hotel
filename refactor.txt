NOTES

REFACTORS: 

Removed Date.parse dates scattered throughout code. Made Date objects for tests. My code assumes that all dates entered into the program will be instances of Date.

Reservation 16: originally had a variable to hold Room Rate, removed in favor of retrieving the rate from the instance of Room

Went back and added ids to Reservations and Blocks.

Res_Man 43: added if/else statement to be less expensive and not call "get_rooms_by_id" if there are no rooms.

Moved "discount" from Block to Reservations class.

Removed "list_discounted_rates" from Block, revamped "calculate_total_cost" instead.
